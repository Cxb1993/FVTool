# FVTool: Finite volume toy toolbox for Matlab
This is a finite volume (toy) toolbox for chemical/petroleum engineers. 
Right now, it can solve a transient convection-diffusion equation with variable velocity field/diffusion coefficients. The discretization schemes 
include:
  * central difference diffusion term
  * central difference convection term
  * upwind convection term
  * TVD convection term
  * transient term
  * Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and periodic boundary conditions
## How to start
Download the package, start matlab, and run

You can see a very early document and tutorial by typing (in matlab command line)

## Inspiration
I started writing this tool after playing with [FiPy] (http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/), an amazing python-based finite volume solver. 
This matlab solver is not a clone, and indeed very limited compared to FiPy.
I wrote it to have a very handy tool for testing new ideas (new mathematical models) by solving them in 1D uniform Cartesian grids. 
Then I extended the code to 
  * 1D axisymmetric (radial)
  * 2D Cartesian
  * 3D Cartesian
  * 2D axisymmetric
  
I have overloaded some of the matlab operators to simplify the switch from 1D codes to 2D and 3D.

## Examples
There are a few simple examples in the [Tutorial] (https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool/tree/master/Examples/Tutorial) folder. 
You can also find a few more advanced examples (water injection into a heterogeneous oil field, two nonlinear PDE's, coupled 
fully implicit solution) in the [Advanced] () folder.

## But Matlab is not a free software?
You can use the code in [octave] (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). 
It's not fully compatible because you cannot overload operators for octave builtin types. 
If you avoid using the overloaded operators, it works fine. I've written/am writing the code in [Julia] (http://julialang.org/). It goes well, but 
the visualization and sparse solvers of Julia are not mature yet.
