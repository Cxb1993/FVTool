# FVTool: Finite volume toy toolbox for Matlab
This is a finite volume (toy) toolbox for chemical/petroleum engineers. 
Right now, it can solve a transient convection-diffusion equation with variable velocity field/diffusion coefficients. The discretization schemes 
include:
  * central difference diffusion term
  * central difference convection term
  * upwind convection term
  * TVD convection term
  * transient term
  * Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and periodic boundary conditions

## which equation do we solve?
We an solve the following equation:

$$ \alpha\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial t}+\nabla.\left(\mathbf{u}\phi\right)+\nabla.\left(-D\nabla\phi\right)+\beta\phi=\gamma $$

with the boundary condition:

$$a\nabla\phi.\mathbf{n}+b\phi=c$$

## How to start
Download the package, start matlab, and run
   `FVToolStartUp`
   
You can see a very early document and tutorial by typing (in matlab command line)
   `showdemo FVTdemo`

## Inspiration
I started writing this tool after playing with [FiPy] (http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/), an amazing python-based finite volume solver. 
This matlab solver is not a clone, and indeed very limited compared to FiPy.
I wrote it to have a very handy tool for testing new ideas (new mathematical models) by solving them in 1D uniform Cartesian grids. 
Then I extended the code to 
  * 1D axisymmetric (radial)
  * 2D Cartesian
  * 3D Cartesian
  * 2D axisymmetric
  
I have overloaded some of the matlab operators to simplify the switch from 1D codes to 2D and 3D.

### A simple example
You can solve a diffusion equation, i.e., $ \nabla. (-D \nabla \phi) = 0 $ by running the following code in Matlab:
```matlab
clc; clear;
L = 50;  % domain length
Nx = 20; % number of cells
m = createMesh1D(Nx, L);
BC = createBC(m); % all Neumann boundary condition structure
BC.left.a(:) = 0; BC.left.b(:)=1; BC.left.c=1; % Dirichlet for the left boundary
BC.right.a = 0; BC.right.b=1; BC.right.c=0; % right boundary
D_val = 1; % value of the diffusion coefficient
D = createFaceVariable(m, D_val); % define the diffusion coefficient over the cell faces
Mdiff = diffusionTerm(m, D); % matrix of coefficients for the diffusion term
[Mbc, RHSbc] = boundaryCondition(m, BC); % matix of coefficients and RHS vector for the BC
M = Mdiff + Mbc; % matrix of cefficients for the PDE
c = solvePDE(m,M, RHSbc); % send M and RHS to the solver
visualizeCells(m, c); % visualize the results
```
change the third line to `m = createMesh2D(Nx,Nx, L,L);` or `m = createMesh1D(Nx,Nx,Nx, L,L,L);` and see the outcome for yourself.

## Examples
There are a few simple examples in the [Tutorial] (https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool/tree/master/Examples/Tutorial) folder. 
You can also find a few more advanced examples (water injection into a heterogeneous oil field, two nonlinear PDE's, coupled 
fully implicit solution) in the [Advanced] (https://github.com/simulkade/FVTool/tree/master/Examples/Advanced) folder.

## But Matlab is not a free software?
You can use the code in [octave] (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). 
It's not fully compatible because you cannot overload operators for octave builtin types. 
If you avoid using the overloaded operators, it works fine. I've written/am writing the code in [Julia] (http://julialang.org/). It goes well, but 
the visualization and sparse solvers of Julia are not mature yet.

## Other codes
I have a PVT tool (phase equilibrium calculations) in matlab, which is not ready to be shared yet. The code must be commented and revised.
That's the reason that you get a warning when you run the FVToolStartUp script.
