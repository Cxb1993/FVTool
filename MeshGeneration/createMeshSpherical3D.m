% MeshStructure = createMesh3D(Nr, Ntheta, Nz, Radius, theta, height)
% MeshStructure = createMesh3D(facelocationR, facelocationTheta, facelocationPhy)
% builds a uniform 3D mesh:
% Nx is the number of cells in x (horizontal) direction
% Ny is the number of cells in y (vertical) direction
% Nz is the number of cells in z (perpendicular) direction
% Lx is the domain length in x direction
% Ly is the domain length in y direction
% Lz is the domain length in z direction
%
% SYNOPSIS:
%   MeshStructure = buildMesh3D(Nx, Ny, Nz, Lx, Ly, Lz)
%
% PARAMETERS:
%   Nx: number of cells in the x direction
%   Lx: domain length in x direction
%   Ny: number of cells in the y direction
%   Ly: domain length in y direction
%   Nz: number of cells in the z direction
%   Lz: domain length in z direction
%
% RETURNS:
%   MeshStructure.
%                 dimensions=3 (3D problem)
%                 numbering: shows the indexes of cellsn from left to right
%                 and top to bottom and back to front
%                 cellsize: x, y, and z elements of the cell size =[Lx/Nx,
%                 Ly/Ny, Lz/Nz]
%                 cellcenters.x: location of each cell in the x direction
%                 cellcenters.y: location of each cell in the y direction
%                 cellcenters.z: location of each cell in the z direction
%                 facecenters.x: location of interface between cells in the
%                 x direction
%                 facecenters.y: location of interface between cells in the
%                 y direction
%                 facecenters.z: location of interface between cells in the
%                 z direction
%                 numberofcells: [Nx, Ny, Nz]

% EXAMPLE:
%   Nx = 2;
%   Lx = 1.0;
%   Ny = 3;
%   Ly = 2.0;
%   Nz = 4;
%   Lz = 3.0;
%   m = buildMesh3D(Nx, Ny, Nz, Lx, Ly, Lz);
%   [X, Y, Z] = ndgrid(m.cellcenters.x, m.cellcenters.y, m.cellcenters.z);
%   [Xf, Yf, Zf] = ndgrid(m.facecenters.x, m.facecenters.y, m.facecenters.z);
%   plot3(X(:), Y(:), Z(:), 'or')
%   hold on;
%   plot3(Xf(:), Yf(:), Zf(:), '+b')
%   legend('cell centers', 'cell corners');
